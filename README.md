This is the public version of this repo as the original contains information that is not to be made public. This was the first piece of useful software that I wrote years ago and has largely been preserved in its original form.

This is a macro creation program I have written to automate the organization of databases. There is a base framework at the top level entitled "Macro_Maker.py" which most of the other programs are based off of.

The structure of each macro is as follows:

    Python files are the custom macro for the operation at hand
    Text files describe in pseudocode how the program works
    CSV files are the list that the macro reads from (only found in later versions)

The reason CSV files are only referenced in later macros is because I found I could get better feedback as to my progress through the parts list including percentage completed, current part name, current part number of the total part numbers completed, and how long it takes to complete each cycle of the macro.

Estimated time to completion may be added at a later date.
